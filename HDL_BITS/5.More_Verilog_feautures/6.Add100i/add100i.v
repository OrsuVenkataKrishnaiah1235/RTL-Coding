//In Verilog, genvar is a special keyword used to declare variables that are used for generating loops and instantiating multiple instances of a module.

//Each instantiation of the one_bit_FA module is given a label using the :Full_adder_block syntax. This label is used to identify the instance of the module in the design hierarchy, and can be useful for debugging and other purposes.
