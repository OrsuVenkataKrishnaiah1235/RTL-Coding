The standard procedure for writing Verilog code for digital designs involves the following steps:

1. Understanding the specifications: Read and understand the system requirements, specifications, and constraints.

2. High-Level Design: Develop a high-level design of the system, including block diagram and system architecture.

3. RTL modeling: Develop RTL models for each module in the system using Verilog.

4. Testbench creation: Create a testbench to verify the RTL design and test the design for various input conditions.

5. Simulation: Run simulations to verify the RTL design and debug the RTL model.

6. Synthesis: Convert the RTL design into a gate-level representation using a synthesis tool.

7. Place and Route: Allocate the gates to physical locations on the target device and route the interconnects using a place and route tool.

8. Timing analysis: Perform a timing analysis to verify that the design meets the required timing constraints.

9. Physical verification: Check the design for any physical design rule violations.

10. Tape-out: Generate the final layout of the design and submit it for fabrication.

11. Silicon validation: Test the fabricated chip to verify it meets the specified requirements.

Note: The above steps may vary slightly depending on the design flow and the tools used, but the general idea remains the same.
